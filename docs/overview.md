# Overview

## Learning Objectives

This lab will give you an introduction to Customer Journey Data Service (CJDS) for Webex Contact Center. Next, you'll access a Webex Contact Center developer sandbox, get hands-on with modifying an IVR flow in the Flow Designer tool, and utilize a Bruno collection to make API calls & send JDS events in the flow. Then, you'll validate the flow by calling the assigned inbound phone number and test the IVR as a customer. After that, you'll explore the Agent Desktop and observe how it all comes together inside of a Widget.
